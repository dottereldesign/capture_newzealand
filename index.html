                <p> This was a great experience which had us visiting and photographing the best ‘authentic New Zealand’
                    locations
                    utilising the best light. Phillip possesses a wealth of experience, skill and expertise which he is
                    able to
                    share with each individual photographer… a great deal of effort is made to ensure that each
                    individual has their
                    own needs and goals met; whether these be photographic or personal. Some people may ask is a trip
                    like this
                    worth the cost? My response would be if you are looking for a professional, impeccably organised way
                    of
                    photographing the South Island that provides the opportunity to improve your skills – all while
                    travelling with
                    fun, like-minded people; it is more than worth it and you would be hard-pressed to find better.</p>

                <p> I have participated in a number of photo workshops both in the USA and overseas, and this particular
                    trip is the
                    best I have attended. Phillip has worked hard to develop a great itinerary for his guests, including
                    good food
                    and outstanding coffee. With only 6 participants, we were able to get to know everyone and develop a
                    good
                    camaraderie. Phillip is always ready with advice when in the field; I came home with a number of
                    outstanding
                    images. I definitely recommend Capture New Zealand.</p>

                <p> I’m going over my images while waiting to depart from the Christchurch airport – what an amazing
                    trip! Thanks so
                    much for your instruction, sherpa and guiding, my images are so much better due to y’all. I really
                    enjoyed my
