                    <p>Finding undiscovered photographic destinations which boast spectacular and secluded scenery is
                        becoming a rarity these days. As the leaders in opening up explorations into new territories we
                        are
                        excited to offer the unique and exclusive opportunity to photograph mainland New Zealand's most
                        inaccessible and least-visited wilderness: the hidden realm of Fiordland.</p>

                    <p>Named Ata Whenua by
                        early
                        MƒÅori, which translates to Shadowlands, the name evocatively captures the mood and
                        mysteriousness of
                        the landscapes found here. Weather-scarred coastlines give way to a labyrinth of glacier-carved
                        waterways which lead deep into the Fiordland interior, where ranks of precipitous mountains
                        tower
                        over the island-dotted waters. As well as the incredible scenery these waters are home to
                        dolphins,
                        penguins, seals, albatross, and other pelagic bird species.</p>
                    <p>This exceptional photography
                        expedition
                        begins with a 7-day deep exploration of Fiordland's southern fiords, which are only accessible
                        by
                        sea, aboard a comfortable and spacious purpose-built vessel. Each day's photography will be
                        tailored
                        to take advantage of the prevailing weather conditions, with landings scheduled to explore from
                        shore and venture into the forest interior. The isolation of the fiords we sail through has been
                        beneficial in ensuring their epic beauty remains virtually unspoiled and undisturbed, and we
                        will be
                        capturing incredible images of what is considered the most unexplored wilderness of mainland New
                        Zealand. </p>
                    <p>Upon our return to land, we then set up base in Te Anau, the picturesque lakeside town
                        on
                        the fringe of the Fiordland National Park. During our 3-day stay here we will take two private
                        helicopter flights high into the Fiordland mountains, spending time in hidden locations which
                        offer
                        spectacular opportunities to capture never-before-seen photographs. We will also make a day trip
                        through to Milford Sound, stopping to photograph the impressive landscapes along the way.</p>
                    <p>This
                        expedition is ideal for those who enjoy adventure travel with style, and want to capture unique
                        and
                        powerful photographs of the grandeur and beauty of New Zealand's most formidable wilderness.</p>

                <p> This was a great experience which had us visiting and photographing the best ‚Äòauthentic New Zealand‚Äô
                    locations
                    utilising the best light. Phillip possesses a wealth of experience, skill and expertise which he is
                    able to
                    share with each individual photographer‚Ä¶ a great deal of effort is made to ensure that each
                    individual has their
                    own needs and goals met; whether these be photographic or personal. Some people may ask is a trip
                    like this
                    worth the cost? My response would be if you are looking for a professional, impeccably organised way
                    of
                    photographing the South Island that provides the opportunity to improve your skills ‚Äì all while
                    travelling with
                    fun, like-minded people; it is more than worth it and you would be hard-pressed to find better.</p>

                <p> I have participated in a number of photo workshops both in the USA and overseas, and this particular
                    trip is the
                    best I have attended. Phillip has worked hard to develop a great itinerary for his guests, including
                    good food
                    and outstanding coffee. With only 6 participants, we were able to get to know everyone and develop a
                    good
                    camaraderie. Phillip is always ready with advice when in the field; I came home with a number of
                    outstanding
                    images. I definitely recommend Capture New Zealand.</p>
